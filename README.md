# Detecting_Parkinson_Disease_Using_XGBoost
In this we have implement XGBoost Classifier to determine if a person has disease or not. 

### What is Parkinson’s Disease?
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system affecting movement and inducing tremors and stiffness. It has 5 stages to it and affects more than 1 million individuals every year in India. This is chronic and has no cure yet. It is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting dopamine-producing neurons in the brain.

### What is XGBoost?
XGBoost is a new Machine Learning algorithm designed with speed and performance in mind. XGBoost stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting and is based on decision trees. In this project, we will import the XGBClassifier from the xgboost library; this is an implementation of the scikit-learn API for XGBoost classification.

### Overview of this Project
- To build a model to accurately detect the presence of Parkinson’s disease in an individual.
- Load the required libraries, Numpy, Pandas, XGBoost Classifier
- Distribute the data into features and labels
- Scale the features using MinMaxScaler
- Split the dataset
- Build an XGBClassifier 
- Calculate the accuracy of our model

The data-set for this project can be downloaded from the below mentioned link,

[Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/parkinsons/)

The dataset has 24 columns and 195 records and is only 39.7 KB.

[Code](https://github.com/alinauman/Detecting_Parkinson_Disease_Using_XGBoost/blob/main/Detecting%20Parkinson's%20Disease%20with%20XGBoost.ipynb)

This gives us an accuracy of 94.87%, which is great considering the number of lines of code in this python project.
